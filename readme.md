## Gherkin Generator

### Setup

After you download this repo go setup behat as noted on [http://docs.behat.org/]
in a folder named behat at the root of this module.
So you should be able to run behat/bin/behat after you are done.

Also, if using selenium make sure you run it in the background.

Download the jar file to your computer/server

``bash
curl -O http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.31.0.jar
```

Then start it at the command line

```bash
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.31.0.jar
```


If there are any errors check out the drupal reports area under this modules name.

There is an example test include just click the Example button after you enable the module at node/add/gherkin-generator
